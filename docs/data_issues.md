# Data Issues To Investigate

## Gear Slot Assignment Audit Needed

Verified 2026-05-12 by n00b: **Mystic Conduit Mark** (Conduit family Shirt/Trousers
gear) was stored as `slot: "Pants"` across 4 entries (ids 395, 402, 454, 460)
but is actually a **Shirt** slot item in-game. Fixed those 4 entries.

Broader concern — several Conduit-family pieces have suspicious slot
assignments worth verifying:

- **Bloodwoven Ink** appears in both Pants (id 13, id 471) and Shirt
  (id 416, id 423) — same name, two slots. Possibly two distinct NW
  items, or one of them mis-slotted.
- **Tempest Gaze Mark** appears as Shirt (id 341), Pants (id 410), and
  Shirt (id 490) — same naming inconsistency.
- **Mark of the Convert / Adept / Fledgling / Recruit / Novice /
  Initiate** mostly Shirt but a few entries (ids 498, 499, 503) are
  Pants — likely mis-slotted; these have a Shirt-pattern naming.

For each: verify in-game tooltip slot, correct any wrong assignments.
Best path is one Conduit-family piece at a time as n00b encounters them.

## Gear Set Bonuses — Missing Data

### Impending Doom (Paladin / Ranger Main+Off, two-piece set)

The whole set needs structured equipBonuses + Unleashed proc data.
Source pieces in `data/gear.json`:

- **Paladin** — Oathbreaker's Malevolence (Main Hand) + Aegis of the Condemned (Off Hand)
  - IL tiers in data: 3,750 / 4,100 / 4,550 / 4,800 (Mythic) / 5,250 (Celestial)
  - Tier-4800 Off Hand (id 465) has narrative-only set bonus text — the
    rest of the Paladin pieces are completely empty.
- **Ranger** — Grimfang (Main Hand) + Harrowed Messengers (Off Hand)
  - IL tiers in data: 3,750 / 4,100 / 4,450 / 4,800 (Mythic) / 5,250 (Celestial)
  - All pieces have empty equipBonuses.
- **Other classes** (Cleric / Warlock / Bard / etc.) not present in data
  at all — need separate ingestion if they have Impending Doom variants.

**What's missing per piece:**

1. **2pc stat bonus** — class- and role-specific. Known anchor from n00b
   2026-05-12: **Ranger Mythic (IL 4800) 2pc = +7.5% Critical Strike +
   3.7% Accuracy**. Scale to other tiers via the standard tier
   multiplier and verify each rarity in-game.

2. **Unleashed mechanic** — set builds 10 Charges (1 per Daily power use
   on a 10s cooldown; 1 per Encounter on a 1s cooldown; +1 per Nsec in
   combat). On reaching 10, triggers an "Unleashed" buff with
   class/role-specific effects. Per id 465's existing narrative on the
   Paladin variant: Tank −1% Incoming Damage, Heal −1% Outgoing Healing,
   plus +x% Forte and +x% Defense (numbers unverified). Need:
   - charge generation triggers + cooldowns
   - buff duration when unleashed
   - per-class/role stat values

**How to backfill (when ready):**
1. n00b hovers each class/tier variant in-game and pastes the 2pc tooltip text + the Unleashed effect text per role.
2. Structure into equipBonuses with `type: "Set"`, role filter, stat/amount fields, perStack/maxStacks for the Unleashed proc.
3. Engine already supports role-conditional set bonuses (Dark Matter 2pc Healer pattern) and perStack proc bonuses (Critical Harmony pattern) — no engine work expected.

## Companion Power Scaling Issues

### Fixed-Effect Powers (No Scaling)
These powers show the same values at all rarities. Verified in-game — confirmed fixed or scaling added.

- **Elminster's Chain Lightning** (Elminster Simulacrum) — DOES scale. 10x single stat main mag, 2x single stat chain. Old values (66/16.5) were wrong. Report #7 Fixed.
- **Doom and Bloom** (Fireblossom Zealot) — DOES scale. ~3.33x single stat heal % (18.3% at Legendary, ~30% at Celestial). Report #10 Fixed.
- **Ox Stot's Instincts** (Ox Stot) — Confirmed fixed effect. 20% stun 3s does not change (verified IL 150 vs 550). Report #6 Fixed.

- **Fiendish Charmer's Distraction** (Incubus) — 10% daze 3s at all rarities. No report submitted.
- **Succubus's Distraction** (Succubus) — Same as Incubus. No report submitted.

### Special Scaling Patterns
Powers that scale but don't follow standard single/double stat tables.

- **Igneous Skin** (Minotaur) — Reduces damage taken + increases AoE damage. Known values: screenshot showed 10%/7.5%, Celestial is 12%/12%. Non-standard scaling. Deleted bug report #5 after correction.
- **Rattigan the Wise** (Plagueborne Insight) — 4.8% Power + CA per stack at Celestial. Doesn't match standard double (4.50%). Base rarity Mythic.
- **Grace Revoir** (Unseelie Cruelty) — 5% at Mythic, 13.5% at Celestial. Big jump, doesn't match any table.
- **Vampire's Kiss** (Vampire/Vampire Bride) — 3.6% heal at Epic. Doesn't match standard tables.
- **Hollyphant's Guidance** (Lulu the Hollyphant) — DR follows double stat, heal follows single stat. Two different scales on same power.
- **Blaspheme Assassin** (Spiteful Presence) — 6% fixed necrotic + 0.75x single Crit Severity. Mixed fixed/scaling.
- **Wererat Thief** (Wererat Discipline) — Slow at 2.2x single, magnitude at 0.5x standard. Two different scales.
- **Baby Bear** (Baby Bear's Instincts) — Chance at 2x single, stats at 0.75x single. Two different scales.

### Celeste Power Name Fix
- **Celeste** — Was "Divine Answers" (Forte + Outgoing Healing), corrected to "Celeste's Wisdom" (proc heal when below 50% HP). The old "Divine Answers" power (ID 146) may still exist as orphaned data.

### Companion Name Issues
- **Watler** — Was "Wailer" in data, corrected to Watler.
- **Portalhound** — Was "Portalerhound" in data, corrected.
- **Conartist** — Was "Con Artist" in data, in-game shows "Conartist's Discipline".
- **Undying Overlord** (Lich) — Was "Undying Overbound" in data, corrected.
- **Fire Eye** — Removed as duplicate of Blue Fire Eye.
- **Phasespider** — Was assigned wrong power (Phasespider's Instincts = Little White's power). Fixed to Phasespider's Presence.

### Missing Companion Data
- **Little White** — New companion added. Has Phasespider's Instincts (Utility, 3 stats). Enhancement ref not set.
- **Celeste** — New power created (Celeste's Wisdom, ID 259). Verify proc heal scaling matches in-game.
- **Apprentice Healer** — Fixed from IL 75 to IL 150. Has Max HP + Incoming Healing (uses flat HP scaling table).

### Max HP Scaling Table
Used by multiple companions. Verified from in-game screenshots:
- Com: 1,500 | Unc: 3,000 | Rar: 5,000 | Epi: 7,500 | Leg: 11,000 | Myc: 15,000 | Cel: 18,000
- 2x Max HP table (Energon): 3,000 | 6,000 | 10,000 | 15,000 | 22,000 | 30,000 | 36,000
